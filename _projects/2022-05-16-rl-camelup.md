title: "Playing Camel Up with Reinforcement Learning"

This was a project that I started in graduate school. Unfortunately, then, my algorithm never got great at playing, the code was super janky, etc. That code can be found here: `really cool link`.

Now that I have graduated, and don't have to be up until 2 or 3 AM for several weeks debugging code, tweaking parameters, and crying, thought that revamping the whole project would be a really neat idea. Hopefully I won't regret it, but I imagine that I probably will.
