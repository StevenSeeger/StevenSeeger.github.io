  <p>Many applications today are data-intensive, as opposed to compute-intensive. Raw CPU power is merely a limiting factor for these applications - bigger problems are usually the amoutn of data, the complexity of the data, and the speed at which it is changing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some of the standard building blocks to data intensive applications include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>databases</li>
  <li>caches</li>
  <li>search indexes</li>
  <li>stream processing</li>
  <li>batch processing</li>
</ul>

<p>These data systems have been well thought-out, and many solutions have been built. Knowing which solution to use can be a difficult task. Understanding the commonalities and differences between solutions is useful in understanding which tools to use. The first section of the book focuses on three key concepts:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Reliablity - Systems works correctly even in the face of adversity</li>
  <li>Scability - Growth in volume is able to be handled</li>
  <li>Maintainability - Many people will work on the system, and should be able to do so productively</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="thinking-about-data-systems">Thinking About Data Systems</h2>

<p>Data Systems can be a very broad term that covers a variety of tools (i.e. databases, queues, caches, etc.) To compound the issue, applications are becoming much more demanding, and tools are starting to limit the scope of the tasks it covers. This means that while tools are highly efficient, tools are started to be stitched together in pipelines to provide full usability.</p>

<p>When handling a data system, many questions can arise:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How do you ensure that the data remains correct and complete, even when things go wrong internally?</li>
  <li>How do you provide consistently good performance to clients, even when parts of your system are degraded?</li>
  <li>How do you handle an increase in load?</li>
  <li>What does a good API for the service look like?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="reliability">Reliability</h2>

<p>Basically means, that things are working correctly. What <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">working correctly</code> can mean different things at different companies, but the concept that things still work remains the same. Even when faults are introduced to the system, it should be resilient enough to keep working as expected (with no noticable difference to the end user). Fault-tolerant systems can be formed by delibertly triggering faults, and creating process to correctly handle the faults and errors that are generated.</p>

<p class="notice--warning"><strong>Note:</strong> Faults are different than failures. A fault is a component of the system not operating as expected, where as a failure is when a system stops providing the required usability to the user.</p>

<h3 id="hardware-faults">Hardware Faults</h3>

<p>This occurs when hard disks crash, RAM failes, blackouts, etc. The first response is to add redundancy, which could be replicated data sources, dual power supplies, back-up generators. Obviously this will not prevent all problems, but can keep a machine running well for years. But as data has grown, many places have moved from single machine to multi machine redundancy. This changed the scope of what needs to be handled.</p>

<h3 id="software-errors">Software Errors</h3>

<p>Most hardware faults are random and independent from eath other. Software errors are harder to handle because they are harder to anticipate, and handle because they are correlated. Bugs like these don’t usually occur frequently until unusual circumstances occur. While there may not be a quick and easy solution for these problems, having checks and tests in place to ensure that everything is working as expected can be put in place.</p>

<p class="notice--info"><strong>ProTip:</strong> A good example of a test would be checking the number of messages into a queue equals the number of messages leaving a queue.</p>

<h3 id="human-errors">Human Errors</h3>

<p>Humans are extremely buggy, and therefore write buggy code. A study showed that only 10~25% of outages were hardware faults. So the question remains, how do we ensure realiabilty when faced with human unreliablity?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Design things in a way that minimizes the introductions of errors (abstractions, unit tests, APIs, small code changes)</li>
  <li>Decouple places where people make mistakes, and where people use the system (i.e. a sandbox env)</li>
  <li>Testing</li>
  <li>Quick and easy recovery methods from human error (easy to revert/rollback, tools to recompute data, etc.)</li>
  <li>Telemetry and montoring</li>
  <li>Good practices and training</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-important-is-reliability">How Important is Reliability?</h3>

<p>Reliability is not just to prevent the world from ending, but to ensure productivity and to keep away from legal issues. This can range from ensuring that companies using services are kept happy, but also to ensuring that a person’s pictures and videos are kept valid and accessible.</p>

<h2 id="scalability">Scalability</h2>

<p>A system meant to handle 10,000 users may not work for 100,000 users. Being able to handle changes in the amount of things handled by a system is usually under the scope of scalability. This isn’t a one and done question, but can be thought about in terms of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If the system grows in a particular way, what are our options for coping with the growth?</li>
  <li>How can we add computing resources to handle the additional load?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="describing-load">Describing Load</h3>

<p>In order to determine how to scale, load parameters must be defined. The best choice for this will depend on the architecture of the system, but it may include numbers such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Requests per second to web server</li>
  <li>Ratio of reads to writes in DB</li>
  <li>Number of simultaneously active users</li>
  <li>Hit rate on cache</li>
</ul>

<p class="notice--info"><strong>ProTip</strong> You may want to look at averages, but bottnecks may be due to edge/extreme cases</p>
