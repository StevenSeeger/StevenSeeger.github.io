        <p>Thanks for visiting my “About Me” page! Not sure why you would ever take an interest in me, or my background. Or really anything else I have to write.</p>

<h2 id="education">Education</h2>

<p>I got my Bachelor in Statistics at Brigham Young University, completeing coursework both related to Statistical Science and Data Science. Those are just fancy ways of saying I did some more fundamental math courses and programming courses to supplement the statistic classes I was taking at the time. I got my Master of Computer Science with a Specialization in AI at Dakota State University. My coursework there revolved around computer science and theory, while also branching out to Artificial Intelligence in the modern age.</p>

<h2 id="professional-work">Professional Work</h2>

<p>I probably won’t write out a ton here, but if you want a better explanation of what I did professional, stalk me on LinkedIn.</p>

<h2 id="other-tidbits">Other Tidbits</h2>

<h3 id="fake-data-nerd">Fake Data Nerd</h3>

<p>You might wonder why I call myself a “Fake Data Nerd”. Maybe its some cruel joke that I experienced while working, or while studying at school. Maybe my siblings (who are all a million times smarter than me) pressured me into feeling like a failure. Sorry to disappoint everybody, but it was like the only thing that I could thing of. Plus I think it is weird how people call themselves or have titles like “Data Nerd” or “Data Ninja”. So its also partly ironic.</p>

<h3 id="my-opinion-on-data-titles">My Opinion on Data Titles</h3>

<p>While writing out the bit about why I chose Fake Data Nerd, it also occured to me that I don’t really love position titles such as “Data Scientist” or “Data Engineer”. But thats just me. Maybe I will write about it more some day, or maybe you can figure it out from other stuff I post. That being said, don’t be offended if you really like those names. We can still be friends (but thats unlikely because I don’t normally consider strangers friends), and I will gladly support anyone in their desire to become a Data Scientist or Data Engineer.</p>

<p class="notice--info">Fun fact: I actually work/worked as a Data Scientist and Data Engineer.</p>

<h3 id="food---eating-cooking--baking">Food - Eating, Cooking &amp; Baking</h3>

<p>I like food. And sometimes I cook. Sometimes I bake. Sometimes I go out to each and I harshly judge the food. Maybe one day I will start posting my opinions about food here. Not to brag or anything, but I have had over 20+ years experience eating food from many different places. Homecooked meals to fancy restaurants. I don’t have the most refined flavor palette, and I don’t know that most people would even agree with my tastes. But I started this website to put out my unsolicated thoughts, notes and projects about computer and math nerd stuff. Might as well post about food stuff online and make even more people mad.</p>
