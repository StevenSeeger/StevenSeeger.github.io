Thanks for visiting my "About Me" page! Not sure why you would ever take an interest in me, or my background. Or really anything else I have to write.

## Education

I got my Bachelor in Statistics at Brigham Young University, completeing coursework both related to Statistical Science and Data Science. Those are just fancy ways of saying I did some more fundamental math courses and programming courses to supplement the statistic classes I was taking at the time. I got my Master of Computer Science with a Specialization in AI at Dakota State University. My coursework there revolved around computer science and theory, while also branching out to Artificial Intelligence in the modern age.

## Professional Work

I probably won't write out a ton here, but if you want a better explanation of what I did professional, stalk me on LinkedIn.

## Other Tidbits

### Fake Data Nerd

You might wonder why I call myself a "Fake Data Nerd". Maybe its some cruel joke that I experienced while working, or while studying at school. Maybe my siblings (who are all a million times smarter than me) pressured me into feeling like a failure. Sorry to disappoint everybody, but it was like the only thing that I could thing of. Plus I think it is weird how people call themselves or have titles like "Data Nerd" or "Data Ninja". So its also partly ironic.

### My Opinion on Data Titles

While writing out the bit about why I chose Fake Data Nerd, it also occured to me that I don't really love position titles such as "Data Scientist" or "Data Engineer". But thats just me. Maybe I will write about it more some day, or maybe you can figure it out from other stuff I post. That being said, don't be offended if you really like those names. We can still be friends (but thats unlikely because I don't normally consider strangers friends), and I will gladly support anyone in their desire to become a Data Scientist or Data Engineer. 

Fun fact: I actually work/worked as a Data Scientist and Data Engineer.
