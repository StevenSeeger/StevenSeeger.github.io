"Why We Sleep?" was a very interesting read on... why we sleep if that wasn't apparent by the title. Just want to preface this review, I did additional research on the book before, during and after I read it on the claims and research portrayed in the book. It seems like some people feel like some claims might be false and/or research might have been misrepresented. I am by no means a professional at all in sleep (even if I have been doing it since before I was born). I read this book with a large grain of salt, but found many things to be enlightening, even they might not have been the purest of pure in regards of how some ideas were portrayed.

Sleep has a large influence on our lives. We (ideally) spend 8 hours of the 24 hours sleeping. The type of sleep we get during those 8 hours are largely split into 2 classes, REM and NREM sleep. Each play their in part in how humans function and the amount of which we get of each changes over time, but for the majority of our lives, it seems to be largely NREM for the first part of the night, followed by segement of REM sleep before we wake up. While losing 2 hours of sleep may not seem like much, that represents 25% of the sleep we need daily. Depending on when we lose this sleep, we cut into a large chunk of either NREM sleep or REM sleep. Which both negatively affect our daily lives (even if we don't realize it, which I will get to later on).

A lot of people drink caffine throughout the day to help them regain energy, get out of drowiness, etc. What this does, is mainly block receptors in our brain from accepting the "I am becoming tired" hormones in our brain. This hormone still builds up though, and when the caffine stops blocking those receptors, we experience a caffine crash, and getting fully hit by the tired hormones that have built up. Although this crash may hit, it does not mean that the brain has fully disposed of caffine, and even if sleep is acheived after a heavy dose of caffine, it affects the amount of deep sleep that we are able to acheive. This means that we may wake up without the proper rest needed, impaired learning functions, etc.

A lack of sleep also negatively affects our overall health. As mentioned above, we don't retain information as easily. We also become hungerier and eat more, blood pressure spikes, the body is not able to easily digest glucose in the body, among other things.
