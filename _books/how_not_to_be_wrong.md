The book starts off with the age old question: "Will I ever actually use this?" And answers it rather well. Learning mathematics, even if you aren't going to be doing mathematics professionally, helps people develop critical thinking skills, and allows us to view problems in different ways. So the next time you may be tempted to ask why a little boy has 54 apples, and wants to split it unevely between 3 friends, just know that it is allowing you to shape your mindset to think about how you went out to a restaurant with friends, and the person that ordered more food than everyone else wants to split the check evenly.

In a more serious example that the author uses, during World War II, there was a group of people working on determining on where to add more armor to planes. One of the people working on the project broke the problem into its elements, trying to understand the assupmtions being made, setting some variables to 0 (or in other words, assuming the worst case possible for a certain aspect of the problem, how does that change the problem), etc. This allowed them to suggestion solutions that were different than the first general assumption about the data.
